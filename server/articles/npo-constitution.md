Constitution of the “Alakajam!” association

## <a name="a0"></a>PREAMBLE

Making games and in particular video games brings together a variety of disciplines. From programming, game design and project planning to graphic arts and sound production, it lets people practice a large variety of skills and grants a lot of creative freedom.

Game jams are events in which people gather for the purpose of making games within a short span of time. They are known to be a great setting for enthusiasts to meet other like-minded people and make games without the complexity and pressure of bigger projects. During jams, people of all skill levels can experience the satisfaction of finishing a game, having other people play it and exchange feedback.

We think that creating a non-profit association is a good way to ensure the successful governance of a community organizing game jams.

## <a name="a1"></a>ARTICLE 1 - NAME

The founding members who hereby establish the present statutes create an association governed by the law of July 1st 1901, having as title: « Alakajam! ».

## <a name="a2"></a>ARTICLE 2 - PURPOSE

The association’s core aim is to create and animate a peaceful, welcoming and tolerant community focused on game making.

The association publishes a website where enthusiasts can meet, create games, exchange feedback and learn.

It organizes game jams and other types of events related to games & game making. While most of these events are held online through the association’s website, it may also organize on-site events. The association may help its members and partners organize events, either online or on-site.

## <a name="a3"></a>ARTICLE 3 - PRINCIPAL OFFICE

The principal office of the association is situated in `[address redacted]`. Email: contact@alakajam.com

This office can be transferred to another place on the decision of a general assembly.

## <a name="a4"></a>ARTICLE 4 - DURATION

The association has an unlimited duration.

## <a name="a5"></a>ARTICLE 5 - COMPOSITION

The association is comprised of members, whose role is to contribute to meetings, participate in decisions (in particular through votes), and help in the realization of the activities.

Membership to the association is based on merit. Every physical or moral person can become a member, without distinction of social, political or geographical origin, of race, of sex, of nationality, of religion, as long as they have shown lasting interest in helping with the association, and match its overall values.

Membership can also be offered to a person for honorific reasons.

## <a name="a6"></a>ARTICLE 6 - ADMISSION

To be part of the association, one must:
**1)** Request or accept membership;
**2)** Be accepted by any member of the board of directors, at the time of a general meeting or assembly;
**3)** Wait for 48 hours after his acceptance, during which existing members can object for the admission. If at least three members or one board member object to the admission, the wait period is extended to allow deliberation, up to a maximum of two weeks. During the wait period, if a majority within the board of directors oppose the admission, or if a general vote at the joint initiative of at least three members concludes to opposing the admission, then the membership is rejected.

Membership is given for an unlimited duration.

## <a name="a7"></a>ARTICLE 7 - CONTRIBUTION

Membership does not require any financial contribution.

## <a name="a8"></a>ARTICLE 8 - REVOCATION

Membership can be lost by:
**a)** Resignation;
**b)** Exclusion, as decided by a majority within the board of directors. It can also be requested through a general vote at the joint initiative of at least three members. The target member must be notified at least 2 days before the start of the procedure, and can provide a written response to appeal the decision;
**c)** Inactivity, meaning the absence of a member from all activities for one year or more. The revocation is only effective 30 days after its announcement. If the member objects within these 30 days, the revocation is cancelled;
**d)** Death.

All revocation of membership must be decided at the time of a general meeting or assembly.

## <a name="a9"></a>ARTICLE 9 - RESOURCES

The financial resources of the association comprise of:
**1)** Donations from physical or moral persons ;
**2)** State subsidies and other public collectivities ;
**3)** Sale of merchandising items, and all other economic activities or resources authorized by law.

## <a name="a10"></a>ARTICLE 10 - ORDINARY GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The ordinary general assembly regroups all the members of the association. It must be held once a year, on the convocation of the secretary. The convocation must list the agenda of the meeting and be sent at least two weeks before the date.

During this assembly:
**a)** The secretary, assisted by the counselors, presides the assembly, and presents a report on the activities or moral situation of the association;
**b)** The treasurer presents a report on the finances of the association;
**c)** Only topics from the agenda must be discussed.

All decisions are taken by the majority of people present or represented.

Once all the agenda has been covered, the assembly proceeds to the election of the board of directors. The board is elected among one or more lists detailing the composition of its candidate board. Electing the board of directors requires a quorum of 1/3 of all members. If the quorum cannot be attained during the general assembly, a general vote must be held instead within two weeks.

## <a name="a11"></a>ARTICLE 11 - SPECIAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY

The secretary, or a common request from 1/3 of all members, can trigger the convocation of a special general assembly. The requirements of the convocation are the same as for the ordinary general assembly.

The dissolution and anticipated election of the board of directors can be made part of the agenda for this assembly. If so, the convocation must provide reasoning that either:
**1)** Too many members of the board of directors are inactive for it to work normally;
**2)** One or more members of the board of directors have shown serious misconduct requiring the removal of his powers.

The dissolution requires the approval of either the secretary, or the majority of the board, or the majority of the members through a general vote (with a quorum of 1/3). If the dissolution is confirmed, the assembly will immediately elect a new board, following the same process as for the ordinary general assembly.

## <a name="a12"></a>ARTICLE 12 - GENERAL MEETINGS AND VOTES

Due to the largely online activities of the association, meetings and votes held by the association usually cannot be held in physical presence. Here are defined “general meetings” and “general votes” and the rules they must follow, so that all members can contribute to the association’s activities.

A general meeting must either take place:
**a)** On a real-time messaging system accessible to all members. If so, the convocation must list the location and agenda of the meeting and be sent at least 48 hours in advance. A report must then be shared to all members at most 48 hours after the end of the meeting;
**b)** Or on an asynchronous messaging system (eg. mailing-list). The meeting can be considered closed if no objection is made 48 hours after a request to end the meeting. A meeting cannot last more than a week.

A general vote must:
**a)** Be announced and be open to all members;
**b)** Stay open for at least a week;
**c)** Report the final decision within 48 hours after the end of the voting period.
Unless an article, by-law or the vote itself mentions otherwise, a general vote does not have a quorum. In case of tie, the final choice is decided between tied options by a majority within the board of directors. All votes, unless mentioned otherwise, are decided by simple majority.

## <a name="a13"></a>ARTICLE 13 – BOARD OF DIRECTORS

The association members elect among them a board of directors (or « council of jamicians »). A board of directors must always have an odd number of people, and is elected for a mandate of one year. It is composed of the following roles:

**a)** One secretary (or « scribe »): Main representative of the association. Presides the general assemblies, and writes the report on the activities or moral situation of the association. Ensures the association functions normally, and that its members respect its constitution and bylaws.

**b)** One treasurer (or « master of coin »): In charge of managing all financial resources. Keeps bookkeeping documents to date, and produces the financial report for the ordinary general assembly. Handles most expenses required by the activities.

**c)** Zero or one lead developer: Leads the website development, and ensures it remains consistent with the goals of the association and its board. Leads the management of the website servers.

**d)** Zero or more counselors: On top of voting rights within the board, each counselor can be assigned a variety of responsibilities. Attributions can include, among others, to:
 - Assist the secretary or treasurer with his responsibilities
 - Conduct general meetings or votes, and write meeting reports
 - Decide the event calendar
 - Lead the organization of events
 - Administrate the website and nominate moderators
 - Ensure social media activity of the association
 
Each counselor can be given a more specific title to match his responsibilities. While these responsibilities are recommended to be assigned to the board of directors, they can also be delegated to other members of the association. These responsibilities can be reassigned at any time.

A board member cannot cumulate secretary and treasurer powers.

## <a name="a14"></a>ARTICLE 14 – COMPENSATIONS

All roles within the association, including those of the board of directors, are volunteer work. Upon presentation of receipts, members can be refunded expenses spent in association-related activities, provided that the treasurer has approved said expenses. The financial report presented during the ordinary general assembly must show, for each beneficiary, the amounts refunded in a such manner.

 
## <a name="a15"></a>ARTICLE 15 – CONSTITUTION AND BY-LAWS

The revision of the present constitution can only be made during a general assembly, and requires a quorum of 1/3. If the quorum cannot be attained, a general vote must be held instead within two weeks.

By-laws can be established by the board of directors. Their goal is to regulate various topics not covered by the present constitution. The establishment and updates of by-laws must be approved by a general vote.

## <a name="a16"></a>ARTICLE 16 – DISSOLUTION

The dissolution of the association can occur through a decision taken by a special general assembly and a majority of 2/3 of its members. In case of the dissolution of the association, the remainder of its holdings after an auditing of its debts is to be bequeathed to all organization, association or institution pursuing similar goals. Holdings cannot be bequeathed to a member of the association, even partially, except for taking back a contribution.

## <a name="a17"></a>ARTICLE 17 – GIFTS

The reports produced for the ordinary general assembly are sent each year to the prefect of the department.

The association commits to present its registers and accounting documents upon any requisition from the administrative authorities concerning the use of gifts it may receive, to let its offices be visited by representatives of these competent authorities, and to report on the situation of said offices.
