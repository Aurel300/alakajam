Feedback Fortnight rules

*Feedback Fortnight* is an annual event where you are invited to submit *any game you worked on this year*. While you can use this event as a game jam, you can actually use it to get feedback on a longer term project you're working on, or maybe a game from a past jam that you improved since.

## Divisions

The only available division is *Open*, as the event doesn't produce winners. The focus is on plain feedback.

## Schedule

1. **Before the event**: All you can do is create blog posts. Feel free to introduce yourself or the game you plan to make/submit.
2. **Submission week-end**: When the event launches, you have a week-end to prepare your game if needed, and of course submit it to the website.
3. **Exchanging feedback**: Once games are submitted, everyone gets to play and comment on each other's games for a couple weeks. The more games you comment on, the higher your own is featured in the games list!

## Results

At the end of the event, the most dedicated reviewers will be announced as this year's *Feedback Champions*, by a completely subjective jury :) The games theirselves don't get any ratings or rankings.

## What is allowed/not allowed?

It's okay if the game is unfinished, closed-source, made as a team, we don't  mind either if the game was started before the current year. The only requirements are that the game must be yours, and is made playable for free.

All third-party assets are allowed as long as you have the license to use them.
