Kajam rules
*Kajam* competitions are month-long events in which people make a video game from scratch, focusing each time on a specific aspect of game making, as chosen by its host. They are smaller, more relaxed events than the main competitions, and are perfect to learn, experiment and improve your gamedev skills.

## Divisions

Anyone can enter in one of the following divisions, unless a particular Kajam is organized differently:

* **Ranked**, in which you make a game either alone or as a team ;
* **Open**, for those not interested in the competitive aspect of the event, or who want to enter without focusing on the monthly topic.

Everyone has usually three to four weeks to submit their entries.

## Rankings

In the case of a ranked jam, *everyone* with an Alakajam! account is able to play, rate and comment other people's games for one week, until the final results are released.

On each Ranked game you play, you will get to rate **a single aspect of the game, being the topic of the month**. You won't even see an *Overall* rating category, so making a finished, polished game with enough contents is not necessarily the goal!

*Open* division games won't get ratings but can expect as much plays & feedback as the others.

## What is allowed/not allowed?

Unless a particular *Kajam* states otherwise, those simple rules apply:

* Ranked entries cannot be games started before the event ;
* All third-party assets are allowed as long as you have the license to use them.

Note: For best feedback, it is advised to let people know what you did/did not make during the jam.
