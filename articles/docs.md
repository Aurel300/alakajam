Welcome!
Alakajam! is a young community gathering game development enthusiasts from all backgrounds. We host a series of informal events, that give you a chance to both make games *and* get people to play them:

* **Alakajam!** competitions, taking place over a week-end, three times a year. Start/end times are suited to Europan timezones.
* **Kajam!** month-long events, inviting people to learn and experiment around a specific topic.
* And finally **Feedback Fortnights**, to show off personal projects made outside of game jams.

Sounds exciting? Come join us! You can start by making an account [in a few clicks](/register), then check the home page or the [Events](/events) to learn the date of the next jam. Feel free to introduce yourself [with a blog post](/post/create)!

If you want to give a hand to this brand new community: spread the word, [give feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMwNehfQBGKvsMEE2VYuH_9WbbNb2hZ3F1dIC_UPy9c294w/viewform?usp=sf_link) and if you're a coder, why not [join us on Github](https://github.com/mkalam-alami/alakajam)!
