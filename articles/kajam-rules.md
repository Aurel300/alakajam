Kajam rules

> This is a draft. Rules might change by the start of the 1st Kajam.

*Kajam* are month-long competitions in which people make a video game from scratch, focusing each time on a different, specific aspect of game making chosen by its host. They are perfect to learn, experiment and improve your gamedev skills.

## Divisions

Anyone can enter in any of the following divisions:

* **Solo**, in which you make a whole game alone ;
* **Team**, in which any number of persons can gather to make a game ;
* **Unranked**, for those not interested in the competitive aspect of the event.

Everyone has around three weeks to submit their games.

## Rankings

After the jam, Solo and Team divisions will be ranked separately through community voting: any person who entered the event will be able to play, rate and comment other people's games for one week, until the final results are released.

On each game you play, you will get to rate **a single aspect of the game, which is the topic of the month**. There will even not be an *Overall* rating category, so making a finished, polished game with enough contents is not necessarily the goal.

Unranked games won't get ratings but can expect as much plays & feedback as the others.

## What is allowed/not allowed?

Unless a particular *Kajam* states otherwise, those simple rules apply:

* You cannot work on a game you started before the event.
* All third-party assets are allowed as long as you have the license to use them.

Note: For best feedback, it is advised to let people know what you did/did not make during the jam.
