Kajam rules

*Kajam* competitions are month-long events in which people make a video game from scratch, focusing each time on a specific aspect of game making, as chosen by its host. They are perfect to learn, experiment and improve your gamedev skills.

## Divisions

Anyone can enter in any of the following divisions:

* **Ranked**, in which you make a game either alone or as a team ;
* **Unranked**, for those not interested in the competitive aspect of the event, or who want to submit a game without focusing on the theme.

Everyone has around three weeks to submit their entries.

## Rankings

After the jam, any person who entered the event will be able to play, rate and comment other people's games for one week, until the final results are released.

On each Ranked game you play, you will get to rate **a single aspect of the game, being the topic of the month**. You won't even see an *Overall* rating category, so making a finished, polished game with enough contents is not necessarily the goal!

Unranked games won't get ratings but can expect as much plays & feedback as the others.

## What is allowed/not allowed?

Unless a particular *Kajam* states otherwise, those simple rules apply:

* You cannot work on a game you started before the event.
* All third-party assets are allowed as long as you have the license to use them.

Note: For best feedback, it is advised to let people know what you did/did not make during the jam.
