F.A.Q.
## <a name="anon-entry"></a>Allowing anonymous comments

Enabling this option allows all users to post anonymous comments on your entry. Doing so gives them a free hand for posting direct, unfiltered feedback about your game, pleasant or not. If you don't feel comfortable with strong criticism, please keep this option disabled.

If you enable the option, you may change your mind later, but comments posted anonymously will of course remain anonymous.

## <a name="anon-comment"></a>Commenting anonymously

If the owner of an entry allowed it, you can choose to post a comment anonymously. This allows you to provide honest feedback (even unpleasant) in the safest conditions. Anonymous comments can still be identified by administrators (though only by running database queries), to moderate any form of hateful, offensive or insulting comments. 

Anonymous comments do not count towards your feedback score.

## <a name="optouts"></a>Opt-outs

When entering the Solo or Team division, you can opt-out of certain rating categories. This is completely optional and depends on each game and your personal preference.

* **Graphics**: Opting out can be useful if the game is text-based, or sound only, or if you feel the art is so terrible that it's not worth rating it.
* **Audio**: Opting out is recommended if the game has no sound. You can also do so if the audio is so terrible you think it's not worth rating it.

People who opt out of a category still have to follow the same rules regarding third-party assets.
