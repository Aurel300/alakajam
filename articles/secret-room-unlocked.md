Secret room unlocked!
Dear Ludum-darer,

You just stumbled on *Alakajam!*, a new site made by @wan (creator of Feedback Friends) with the help of other Ludum Dare veterans.

Because the world always needs more game jams, we're building this sort of spin-off community with the goal to organize regular gamedev events:

* **Alakajam!** competitions, taking place over a week-end a bit like Ludum Dare, except that start/end times will be more suited to European timezones.
* **Kajam!** month-long events, inviting people to learn and experiment around a specific topic.
* And finally **Feedback Fortnights**, to show off projects made outside of game jams.

 >  The 1st Alakajam! competition will be held **22-24 September**!

If you're interested or just want to stay in the loop, you can follow us [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alakajambang) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/alakajam). You're also welcome to our [IRC channel](/chat) where were discussing how to reinvent the game jam formula, and of course where we're organizing the [site development](https://github.com/mkalam-alami/alakajam/).

Thanks for reading, and welcome to *Alakajam!*
