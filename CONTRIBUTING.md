# How to contribute

Thanks for taking the time to read this! You're welcome to contribute to Alakajam, even if you're a beginner who just wants to practice TypeScript. Let's all just be aware that this is an Open Source project, which means we're all here for fun, and running this on our free time.

## General tips

* You are allowed to create an issue even for just asking questions. Alternately you can also join our [Discord](https://alakajam.com/chat).
* Issues labeled "[good first issue](https://github.com/alakajam-team/alakajam/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)" should be the most accessible to new contributors.
* Please install the `eslint` Githook mentioned in the [Readme](https://github.com/alakajam-team/alakajam/blob/master/README.md) to ensure your code looks clean.

## What to do if...

* **I found a bug:** Please create an issue explaining the problems in details, and in particular how we could reproduce it (with browser info if relevant). In case of a security vulerability, please share your report privately through one of the contacts [listed here](https://alakajam.com/article/about).
* **I want to develop an existing issue:** Unless the issue is already assigned, work on it right away! You can also post a comment to let us know you're on it.
* **I want to develop an idea I have:** Share your feature idea through an issue first, so that the maintainers can greenlight it and possibly discuss its implementation.
* **I want to share an idea:** Feel free to create an issue or join the [Chat](https://alakajam.com/chat) to discuss it. Note: we keep track of "wish list" features on a separate document so your issue may be eventually closed.
* **Someone has unacceptable behavior:** Please let us know through one of the contacts [listed here](https://alakajam.com/article/about).

Have fun coding a jam site :)
