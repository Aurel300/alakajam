## Cypress tests

This folder contains regression tests written using Cypress.

### Launch

1. Run `npm run start:e2e` in a first terminal, to launch the end-to-end server (will use a special database)
2. Run `npm run cypress` in a second terminal
3. A window will open, letting you run the desired spec

The e2e website can be reached directly at http://localhost:8001.  
You can interact with it to add any data needed to run tests.
